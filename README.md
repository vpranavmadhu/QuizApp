Features

Option Selection Validation: Users cannot proceed to the next question without selecting an option.
Dynamic Scoring: Scores are calculated in real-time using a score state variable.
Final Score Display: After answering the last question, users are presented with their final score.
User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a smooth and intuitive interface for taking quizzes.
How It Works

Option Selection:

Users must select an option to enable the "Next" button.
If no option is selected, the user cannot proceed to the next question.
Score Calculation:

The score is updated dynamically based on the correctness of the selected options.
Final Score:

Once the user completes all questions, the application displays the final score out of the total number of questions.
